# Project Happy Thoughts API

This is an API created by me to hold the data for a happy thoughts generator. 

## The problem

This week the issue has been connecting my backend to my frontend. But after managing to do that I think it has gone well. 

I also added a function where you can choose which kind of thought you are posting and depending on which you choose the color changes.
